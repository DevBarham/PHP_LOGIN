# PHP_LOGIN Repository Readme

Welcome to the PHP_LOGIN repository! This repository contains a simple PHP-based authentication system that can be used as a foundation for building secure login and registration functionality for web applications.

## Features

- User registration with secure password hashing
- User login with session management
- Password reset functionality
- Basic user profile page

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DevBarham/PHP_LOGIN.git
   ```

2. Set up a local development environment with PHP and a database system (e.g., MySQL).

3. Create a new database and import the `database.sql` file included in the repository to set up the required tables.

4. Copy the `config.example.php` file and rename it to `config.php`. Update the configuration settings in `config.php` with your database credentials.

5. Launch a local server (e.g., using PHP's built-in development server) to run the application:
   ```
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

6. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

## Usage

- **Registration:** Visit the registration page and provide the required information to create a new account.

- **Login:** Use your registered email and password to log in securely.

- **Password Reset:** If you forget your password, you can use the password reset functionality by providing your registered email.

- **User Profile:** Once logged in, you can access your user profile page to view or update your information.
